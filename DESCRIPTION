Description: A visual exploration tool for multiple sequence alignment 
    and associated data. Supports MSA of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences 
    using 'ggplot2'. Multiple sequence alignment can easily be combined 
    with other 'ggplot2' plots, such as phylogenetic tree Visualized by 
    'ggtree', boxplot, genome map and so on. More features: visualization 
    of sequence logos, sequence bundles, RNA secondary structures and detection 
    of sequence recombinations.
